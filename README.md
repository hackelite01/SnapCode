## Deploy On Vercel

Deploy you own [SnapCode](https://www.snapcode.cf) on vercel from [HERE](https://vercel.com/new)

## [Docker Support 🐳](https://www.docker.com/)

If you want a self-hosted deployment, SnapCode supports that too,

1. [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile)
2. [docker-compose](./docker-compose.yaml)

**To deploy using docker, use,**

`docker-compose up -d`

> -d -> Detach from the container after creation.
